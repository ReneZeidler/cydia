<title>Ponymotes for AlienBlue</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This tweak adds Ponymotes to AlienBlue. It works for all default emotes in the subreddits /r/mylittlepony and /r/MLPLounge.</p>
<p>Please note: Because of the way the AlienBlue "emote system" (if you can call it that) works, any emotes that have special BPM suffixes will not be displayed, even if the emotes themselves are default. There is no way around this, but it's still better than nothing.</p>
<p>Another side effect is that everytime you open the app, when you want to write a comment in /r/mylittlepony or /r/MLPLounge for the first time since the app's launch, the app hangs for ~10 seconds because it loads all ~1000 emotes (including alternate names and mirrored versions) to be displayed in the emote selector at the top (swipe right on the black topbar to see it). Again, there is really no way around that.</p>
